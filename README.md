# Pull Request: Blockchain-Based Agricultural Equipment Sharing Platform

## Overview

This PR implements a blockchain-based platform for agricultural equipment sharing using Clarity smart contracts. The system enables farmers to register specialized equipment, verify their status, schedule equipment usage, and track maintenance responsibilities.

## Changes

- Created four Clarity smart contracts:
    - `equipment-registry.clar`: For registering and managing agricultural equipment
    - `farmer-verification.clar`: For verifying legitimate farmers
    - `usage-scheduling.clar`: For scheduling equipment usage based on crop cycles
    - `maintenance-tracking.clar`: For tracking maintenance responsibilities

- Added comprehensive test suite using Vitest
- Created documentation including README and this PR details file

## Implementation Details

### Equipment Registry Contract
- Allows farmers to register their equipment with details
- Tracks equipment availability
- Provides functions to query equipment information

### Farmer Verification Contract
- Implements a verification system for legitimate farmers
- Uses authorities to verify farmers
- Allows verification to be revoked if necessary

### Usage Scheduling Contract
- Enables scheduling of equipment based on availability
- Prevents scheduling conflicts
- Allows cancellation of scheduled usage

### Maintenance Tracking Contract
- Records maintenance activities for equipment
- Tracks maintenance history and costs
- Associates maintenance with specific equipment

## Testing

Tests are implemented using Vitest and cover the core functionality of each contract:
- Equipment registration and availability updates
- Farmer verification and authority management
- Equipment scheduling and conflict prevention
- Maintenance recording and tracking

## Next Steps

- Implement a frontend interface for interacting with the contracts
- Add more sophisticated scheduling conflict resolution
- Enhance the maintenance tracking with predictive maintenance features
- Implement a payment/token system for equipment rental
